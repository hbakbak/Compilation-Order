# Compilation-Order
In this project you will be solving a small subset of the problems that a modern compiler must solve when it is compiling code that is spread across multiple files. The compiler can compile only a single file at a time. Since some files may depend on others (via #include statements, for example), it makes sense to compile the files that nothing else depends on first, then to compile files that depend only on those files and so on until all files are compiled. Interestingly, we can represent this dependency as a topological sort of a DAG, which is what you will be doing in this project.
